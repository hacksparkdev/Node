# Node Package Manager (NPM)

- A libray of thousands of packages published by other developers that we can use for free!!
- A command line tool to easily install and manage those packages in our Node projects

### Add packages 
- npm install <package>

###  Import in the .js
```
const color = require('colors');
```

### Global VS local packages

Installing globally means you can use it outside of the current directory.
```
npm i -g cowsay
```
