# Express

## What is Express

Express is a webframework.

It's just an NPM package which comes with a bunch of
methods and optional plugins that we can use to build 
web aplications and API's.

## Express Helps
- Start a server to listen for requests
- Parse Incoming requests
- Match those requests to particular routes
- Craft our http response and associated content


## Libraries VS Frameworks


### library
When you use a library, you are in charge.
You control the flow of the application,
code, and you decide when to use the library.

### Framework
With frameworks, that control is inverted. 
The framework is in charge, and you are
merely a participant! The framework tells
you where to plug in the code.
